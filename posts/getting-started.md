# Getting Started with TweetBlog

Welcome to TweetBlog! This is your new Twitter-inspired blog platform. Here's how to get the most out of it.

## What is TweetBlog?

TweetBlog combines the familiar interface of Twitter with the extended writing capabilities of a blog. Each "tweet" on your profile page is actually a preview of a longer blog post. This gives you the best of both worlds: a clean, familiar timeline view for your readers, with the ability to dive deeper into topics you care about.

## How to Customize Your Profile

To make this blog truly yours, you'll want to customize a few things:

1. Open `index.html` and update the profile information:
   - Change the name, username, and bio
   - Update the profile picture and banner by replacing the placeholder image URLs

2. Modify the CSS in `style.css` to match your personal brand:
   - Change the primary color (currently Twitter blue `#1da1f2`)
   - Adjust fonts, spacing, or any other visual elements

## Creating New Blog Posts

Adding new content is simple! Just follow these steps:

1. Create a new Markdown file in the `/posts` directory
2. Add front matter at the top of your file:
